1.1.9 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node.
For example, chmod 600 <path/to/cni/files>

1.1.20 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node.
For example,
chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt

1.2.1 Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
on the control plane node and set the below parameter.
--anonymous-auth=false

on the control plane node and set the --enable-admission-plugins parameter to include
SecurityContextDeny, unless PodSecurityPolicy is already in place.
--enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...

1.2.22 Edit the API server pod specification file /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

[PASS] 3.2.1 Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created (Manual)
[WARN] 3.2.2 Ensure that the audit policy covers key security concerns (Manual)

== Remediations controlplane ==
3.1.1 Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be
implemented in place of client certificates.

3.2.2 Review the audit policy provided for the cluster and ensure that it covers
at least the following areas,
- Access to Secrets managed by the cluster. Care should be taken to only
  log Metadata for requests to Secrets, ConfigMaps, and TokenReviews, in
  order to avoid risk of logging sensitive data.
- Modification of Pod and Deployment objects.
- Use of `pods/exec`, `pods/portforward`, `pods/proxy` and `services/proxy`.
For most requests, minimally logging at the Metadata level is recommended
(the most basic level of logging).
